neXtSense - P13 Project
=======================

The `neXt Sense`_  programme aims to develop a new generation of automotive sensor
systems through research into new concepts and solutions for the development of
higher-quality products in the field of autonomous driving.

It is structured into four subprogrammes (SP), three of which have a scientific
and technological focus and address the main challenges of autonomous driving:

 - Microsystems technology for automotive sensors (SP1);
 - Reliability and safety in automotive sensors (SP2);
 - Positioning and connectivity for automotive sensors (SP3);
 - Integrated programme management (SP4).

The project ``V2X Communications and Embedded Computing for VRU Safety`` falls
within Subprogramme SP3 – Positioning and Connectivity for Automotive Sensors. 

In this ``V2X Communications and embedded computing for VRU Safety`` project
line, the core objective is to study, develop and validate new vehicular
communication architectures, specifically those involving On-Board Units (OBUs),
Road-Side Units (RSUs), and Fog computing. These innovations aim to better serve
the needs of V2X applications.
